Need to upgrade Jackson libraries in Glassfish server:

*This was causing WebServices to fail the first request after restart the server
*That is why the login in the AMS, sometimes we had to press the buton twice

Steps:
1-Stop domain
2-Remove content of this folder: C:\Glassfish\glassfish\domains\DOMAIN_NAME\osgi-cache\felix
3-In this folder: C:\Glassfish\glassfish\modules
Substitute jackson libraries by the 2.4.4 version:
jackson-module-jaxb-annotations-2.4.4   (This one was not there, so include it)
jackson-jaxrs-json-provider-2.4.4
jackson-jaxrs-base-2.4.4
jackson-databind-2.4.4
jackson-annotations-2.4.4
jackson-core-2.4.4
4-Start domain
